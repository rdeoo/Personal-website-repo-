    <header><h1>About Myself</h1></header>
   
    <p>Hi my name is Rohan Deo and this is a little about myself. I am a typical 18-year-old boy who likes to have fun and socialize but <strong>I also value my alone time a lot</strong>. I am a only child who was born in Surrey, British Columbia and have lived with my two awesome parents ever since. My extroverted side likes to be out and about with my friends or interacting and meeting new and diverse people every day.  On the other hand, my introverted side likes to spend time with family, and my dog, but also enjoy some alone time to think about life or play video games. <strong> I also discovered I love learning</strong>. I donâ€™t mean biology or calculus <strong>I like to learn about people and the whole scope of the IT field</strong>. The IT field interests me because its so vast and uses a platform (computers) I would like to work on. The career paths are also very promising and flexible. Anyways, other than that, I am your good old average young adult! </p>
